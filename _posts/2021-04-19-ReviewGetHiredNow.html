Ian is a founder and the CEO of ZipRecruiter.com and has deep knowledge of the modern job market and how technology has changed the recruiting and job search process. If you or someone you know is looking for a new job, I highly recommend this book.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As someone who has extensive experience in hiring candidates and applying for new positions, I did not expect to learn much from this book. It covered quite a bit of familiar ground, including how to dress for interviews, write follow-up thank yous, and leverage your professional network.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, the coverage of navigating the modern Applicant Tracking System is excellent. With his inside knowledge of how these systems work and how they are evolving, the author provides unique insights into how best to ensure that your application does not get filtered out before a human sees it. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Some of his advice</span><span>&nbsp;is the opposite of </span><span>what used to be considered best practices.</span><span>&nbsp;For example, very few cover letters are ever seen by humans anymore. </span><span>So, unless one is explicitly required, the author recommends that you not submit one</span><span>. Another example is to use an extremely simple resume template. Ian suggests that you </span><span>&quot;write like a caveman&quot;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;because you are writing the resume for the robot processes that will screen your resume. Getting past these automated gatekeepers is one of the biggest hurdles in the modern job search.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>This book has useful information that can improve any job search. It isn&#39;t just for people with college degrees or for those just entering the workforce. However, </span><span>the one area where the book has </span><span>limited coverage is for job seekers with decades of experience. Some of the guidance is difficult to apply in this circumstance. Also, much of the advice works best when applying to private sector companies, especially larger ones. </span><span>Some of the guidance may not work as well in the public sector because of their more formal hiring practices and less reliance on automated applicant screening.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Public sector employers are often much more limited in what they can offer in compensation, so negotiating strategies will need to understand these limits.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Given those few caveats, this is still a very helpful book. Even if you only adopt a few of his suggestions, you will greatly increase your chances of success, which is well worth the price of the book.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p></body></html>
